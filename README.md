##Assignment	1:	Web	Development

25th december- Started the project. started the index page and choose to use roboto font.
26th December-started my CV page. I used the same layout from my index to design this page so the css file used is basically the same. 
29th December Started my Bio page. I decided to make my website have the same layout so that it is consistant throughout. 
5th January - Started my contact page. I had to do some research to find out how to make a static form, and to find out what it was. I then began making my own soon as I understood the basic static forms.
7th January- I added a picture of me which will be on all of my pages like a logo, I also added a home button which sends the user back to the index page.
8th January- added the finishing touches to all my pages and made it so that all pages can be opened from the index page.
12th January- I now believe that my website is ready to be submitted.

Took me about 20 hours to complete.
