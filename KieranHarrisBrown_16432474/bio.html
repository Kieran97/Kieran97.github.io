        <span class="bio-text">Kieran is a funny, cool and calm minded person. He rarely allows anything to get him worried as he believes in himself to get everything that he needs to be done on time.</span>
        <span class="bio-text"> Which is good news because this has allowed him to meet a lot of deadlines he’s had, and has even given him the confidence to hit clutch shots for his college basketball team.</span>
        <span class="bio-text">A heartless shooter on the basketball court and a hard worker at home. When it comes to basketball Kieran believes there is no better shooter (expect for Stephan Curry), as Kieran has spent his later teenage years going to the park and doing his very own shooting drills. When it comes to house chores and getting work done Kieran always gives it 100%, as his mum has pushed him to always look after his home and get work done before anything else.</span>
        <span class="bio-text"> Kieran is known as the ‘Turn Up guy’ because even though he is very calm, he knows how to party and get down you’ll regularly see him in the middle of a circle breaking it down on the dance floor with his cool and swift moves.</span>
        <span class="bio-text">Partying isn’t all Kieran does on his free time or off days, mostly he watches videos about planet earth and its creatures or him and his friends destroy people at video games.</span>
        <span class="bio-text"> All in all Kieran Harris-Brown is a human being that loves to dance, is an amazing shooter and a great house cleaner.</span>
