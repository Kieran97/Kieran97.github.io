        <span class="cv-text">April 2015- March 2016 Park Presentation Host, Chessington World of Adventures
In this role my main job was to keep my set area clean and clear from litter. I did this by doing everything at a set time, for example if I had to do the bins in my area I would always do a bin run as soon as I started, so that I knew all of my bins are empty. Then I would do one before my break, just so that the other person on my area won’t have to worry about the bins. Just before close I would then do a final bin run so that the area will be clear in the morning.
Furthermore, during my time working in PP I learned how to use a radio with proper radio etiquette and how to work in a team.

        <span class="cv-text">April 2016 – August Park Presentation Team Leader, Chessington World of Adventures
In April I got promoted to team leader. This role needed me to set up and be the one to give orders, to help lead the team to our department goal. I did this by leading from the front and setting an example.
This role taught me a lot about staffing as I was trusted to calculate the hours my team worked and send it to admin. I also had to call people and ask if they could come in as I notice my team was short on staff on some particular days. The whole experience of being a Team leader proved to me that I was able to lead and could one day become a manager.
